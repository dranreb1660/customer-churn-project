#  ClASSIFICATION PROJECT: - Predicting Customer Churn

### Abstract:
Customer churn refers to the process of identifying customer/ clients who will terminate their relations with an organisation. It is very important aspect of an organisation as it helps to measure the growth of the company. Hence, The purpose of this project is to build a model to predict if a given customer will churn or not churn using various classification algorithms and techniques


### Data Description
* The data for this project will be obtained from a public data bank source - Kaggle.com and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
* Data will contain about 50,000 observations and some 30 features to explore.
* One individual row in the data singifies one unique observation of a customer's behavior (features)  
Tha data will be stored in a SQL for faster and easy.



### Algorithm
* I intend to explore the data to gain more insightful info before I even start modeling
* I intend to build a classification model to predict if a given custtomer will if a customer will terminate their services (churn) or will continue (Not churn).
* I will explore various classification algorithms to achieve the besst possible classifier by comparing on various metrics. 
* For the purpose of the business, we would like to ensure that we catch as much churns, so we will make recall and f2 score our priority. Though we do not want to predict churn when a customer will not but unability to predict churn will potentialy cost the business money. 

### Tools:
* Python  
* pandas
* SQL
* Scikit-learn

### MVP 
* Thorough EDA to gain insight of the data
* Baseline model to classify if a customer will churn or not. 

### Future/ Time permit
 * we will deploy our model to prouction with the following tools
   * Flask
   * Docker
